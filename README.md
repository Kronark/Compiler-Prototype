# Compiler-Prototype
A collaborative effort towards a fully featured prototype of the Kronark byte compiler design.

## General Code Guidelines
- Naming in *snake-case* (e.g. this_is_a_name)
- Fields are grouped by purpose
- Imports are alphabetically ordered
- Types need to be explicitely defined (no auto, any or similar)
